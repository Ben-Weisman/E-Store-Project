Known Issues:
1. We have some checks in the setters that are un-handled - waiting for the exceptions part of
 the project. (for example - short name input will generate an error).
 
 2. When comparing between two Buyer's carts - we don't calculate the products that has been ordered 
 but not paid for. This is because We've split the cart and checkout carts to two arrays.
